TOGA COARE soundings from R/V Moana Wave
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/2.139

Summary
This dataset consists of sounding data from aboard the Research Vessel (R/V)
Moana Wave which was operated by members of the science team. Soundings were
taken four times daily (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) during participation in the IOP.
UCAR/JOSS conducted no quality control on these data. This dataset includes
pressure, temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, wind
direction, and altitude taken at 10 second vertical intervals. Refer to the
station README file for details. NOTE: This dataset has been updated
(4/23/2002) with corrected data for the humidity measuerment errors of the
Vaisala RS80 radiosonde (Wang et al 2002). Please see the README for
additional information.
